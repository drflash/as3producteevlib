#summary Calling method from the API

= Introduction =

Calling method is really easy if you're used to asynchronous calls in AS3.
All methods are available through the ProducteevService class.

= Method Groups =

Producteev API is splitted in 5 groups :
  * Users
  * Dashboards
  * Tasks
  * Labels
  * Activities

ProducteevService expose each of these group through a property of the same name.

= Calling a method =

  * First, you need to authenticate the user in order to call any other methods. See [LoginProcess]

  * Add an event listener and call the method you re interested in :

{{{
service.dashboards.addEventListener(ProducteevResultEvent.DASHBOARDS_CREATE, createHandler);
service.dashboards.create('myNewDashboard');
}}}

  * Verify the result sent from the server

{{{
private function createHandler(event:ProducteevResultEvent):void
{
  if (event.success)
  {
   //event.data.dashboards contains the result of the call
  }
  else
  {
   //event.data.error contains the error if the call failed
  }
}

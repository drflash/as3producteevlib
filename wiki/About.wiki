= Introduction =

This library has been created to help flash/flex/AIR developers to build applications using producteev API.

Current version (0.9) is a beta version. That means the library hasn't been tested in depth.
Feel free to fill some bugs then.


= Credits = 

As it was the first time I built an AS3 API , I've looked at the source of a lot of others as3 wrapper such as :
[http://developer.yahoo.com/flash/astra-webapis/ Yahoo AS3 API]
[http://code.google.com/p/as3flickrlib/ as3flickrlib]
[http://code.google.com/p/lastfm-as3/ lastfm-as3]

I've found (and used) some interesting ideas from these libraries, so thanks to the people that built them.
